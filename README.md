Hi there, I am new at coding actually and just finished the book I have been studying plus these codes are written by me (some fully by myself, some partially by both myself and taken help from the internet).
So doesn't matter how new I am but still trynna push my limits harder to improve myself, unfortunately, I have not done any big project so far, just these little examples. However, I am ambitious and that's
all for now I think...   Just open to any opportunities.
Thank you
